    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment uses a small subset of the data from Kaggle's [Yelp Business Rating Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013) competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of the data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`yelp.csv`** contains the dataset. It is stored in the course repository (in the **`data`** directory), so there is no need to download anything from the Kaggle website.\n",
    "- Each observation (row) in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.\n",
    "- The **stars** column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.\n",
    "- The **text** column is the text of the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Predict the star rating of a review using **only** the review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** After each task, I recommend that you check the shape and the contents of your objects, to confirm that they match your expectations."

The food is just unhealthy with tons of oil floating on the top of curries, and I am not sure if any health/hygiene code is followed here. \\nThe service is poor and the information on its website is incorrect, the owner does not allow dine-in after 9 or 10 even though it says that the restaurant is open till 11. \\n\\nOne night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands (great example to the servers!). I had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar, and it definitely looked dirty.\\n\\nI have been a lot of hole-in-the-wall places around this restaurant, including Haji Baba, the Vietnamese place and others, but neither any of my friends nor I have fallen sick coz of the food. If you need a spicy-food fix, i strongly recommend you do not try this place, lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day.',\n",

       " \"I'm sorry to be what seems to be the lone one star review.  Either I got there on the worst day in their history, or everyone drank the Koolaid, or I just have different expectations and taste buds.\\nIt seems like a great idea.  It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.  They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera....\\n\\nI chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.  I added bacon for a dollar.\\n\\nFirst, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if:\\n1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch??\\n2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full.\\n3.  They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.\\n\\nAt the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better?\\nAnyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.\\n\\nI finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon.\\nWTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out, but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.\\n\\nAt this point, I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.\\n\\nI couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!\\n\\nExactly one hour and 20 minutes later, I had vicious diarrhea\\n\\nI haven't had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair!\\n\\nNo.  NO.  A thousand times NO!\\n\\nRed Robin is my next burger stop.  Period\",\n",

Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn't put something in the bag.\\n\\nAnd this time it was the yeast.\\n\\nI love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who can't be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, you'd think Whore Foods would smarten up.\\n\\nOr when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that you're a super star, but I don't work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist. \\n\\nBut alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for.\\n\\nOh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didn't stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights. I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply, but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower.\\n\\nUseless motherf*&#$@s!\",\n",

We ordered the antipasto plate and while there were serious issues with it, it turned out to be the best thing we were served. I ordered the chicken rolatini (the special of the day) and it was just plain bad! The chicken was dry and under seasoned, the Rosemary potatoes were soggy  and the veggie medley  (squash, corn, green beans, etc.) was over cooked and the juices spilled over into the potatoes. It was one of the worst $17 meals that I have ever had! My friend ordered the veggie salad and it was one literal hot mess. Just horrible food! I see that others had the mini burgers and bowl of balls and found them to be tasty. I wish I had ordered those. As it is this is one place I would never revisit or recommend to a friend!\",\n",
       " 'Don\\'t know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.\\n\\nWhen I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular \"Chinese\" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should\\'ve went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.\\n\\nUpon checking in with the hostess, they don\\'t even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.\\n\\nOnce we finally got a seat, things got worse.\\n\\nOur \"Har Gow\"/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.\\n\\nThe trademark \"beef internal organs\" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon. \\n\\nThe BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.\\n\\nI understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn\\'t fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too. \\n\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell.',\n",

       " 'Since I have ranted recently on poor customer service, and in the spirit of balance, here is a shining example of how easy it really is.\\n\\nLate last summer  I came home and was shocked to see two of my sunscreens looking quite vandalized. Upon further inspection, it appeared that while using a back mounted leaf blower, one of the landscape crew had brushed against them. The exhaust pipe must have ripped and burned the screen material as well. It was quite the nasty burned melted scar.\\n\\n After staring at it for several hours, I realized there was no virgin Mary, no Jesus, hell it just looked like burned grilled cheese without any deity or lesser apparitions whatsoever, regardless of the angle or my squint. So deciding there was no money to made on eBay, I set out to get them repaired.\\n\\nDid some online searching and decided to call AmeriZona. I explained the situation and was told they could repair them, but I would have to bring them in. These are some pretty large sun screens mind you and packing them into the convertible would have been a challenge.\\n\\nWhile pondering what to do the person helping me on the phone asked me if I could hold on. I could tell it was one of those thinking on your feet light bulb went off type can you hold requests.\\n\\nShe came back on the phone, informed me that she had a crew that was working close by and that she would ask one of the crew to swing by and pick up the screens for repair. She could not promise when they would be repaired, but for that convenience alone I was on board. She had already quoted me the price to repair the screens, and it was very reasonable considering some other online comparisons.\\n\\nSomeone showed up within a few hours to pick up the screens. He could not have been more accommodating, and it was obvious this guy had been working all day and was on his way home. \\n\\nA few days later, Mark  phoned me to tell me my screens were ready and to tell me he was going to drop them off on his way home! Needless to say Mark was also very pleasant to deal with. I believe he was at the time the sales manager. \\n\\nWhen he arrived, the screens looked great, matched the color of the others, even with the sun bleaching over several years. He even offered to put them in! \\n\\nThis experience was way beyond any customer service expectations. No extra charges for any of the above and beyond the call of duty efforts.
